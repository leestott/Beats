This wiki explains how to setup a Raspberry Pi board as a Gateway for ConnectTheDots.io
It assumes that you have the right tools installed and that you have cloned or downloaded the ConnectTheDots.io project on your machine.

##Prerequisites

To build the project you will need Visual Studio 2013 [Community Edition](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs) or above

In terms of hardware, the code provided in the ConnectTheDots.io has been tested on a [Raspberry Pi B/B+](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/)
And you will need and Internet access for the device wired or wireless depending on what you prefer.

##Provision the Raspberry Pi:

* Connect the Raspberry Pi to a power supply, keyboard, mouse, monitor, and Ethernet cable (or Wi-Fi dongle) with and Internet connection.
* Get a Raspbian NOOBS SD Card or download a NOOBS image as per the instructions on http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
* Boot the NOOBS SD Card and choose Raspbian (see http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/ for more information).
* Connect to the Raspberry Pi from your laptop, either via a USB-Serial adapter or via the network via SSH (enable once as per these instructions while booting via a monitor on HDMI and a USB keyboard). To connect using SSH:
    * For Windows, download PuTTY and PSCP from [here](http://www.putty.org/).
    * Connect to the Pi using the IP address of the Pi.
* Once you have connected to the Pi, install on it the Mono runtime and root certs required for a secure SSL connection to Azure:
    * Run the following from a shell (i.e. via SSH). Note: Especially steps 1 and 2 can take a long time to download/un-compress.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install mono-complete
mozroots --import --ask-remove
```

* Create a directory /home/pi/ RaspberryPiGateway. [NOTE: directory names on the Raspberry are CASE SENSITIVE, so raspberrypigateway is not the same as RaspberryPiGateway]:

```
mkdir /home/pi/RaspberryPiGateway
```

* Open the connectthedots\Devices\RaspberryPiGateway\RaspberryPiGateway.sln solution in Visual Studio
* In Visual Studio, update RaspberryPiGateway.exe.config with any one of the four amqp address strings returned by ConnectTheDotsCloudDeploy.exe, i.e. amqps://D1:xxxxxxxx@yyyyyyyy.servicebus.windows.net, and the 
name that you want assigned to your gateway. It is important that the key is being url-encoded, meaning all special characters should be replaced by their ASCII code (e.g. "=" should be replaced by "%3D". You can use tools like [http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/) to url-encode the key 

```
<add key ="EdgeGateway" value="RaspberryPi"/>
<add key="AMQPAddress" value="amqps://[keyname]:[key]@[namespace].servicebus.windows.net" />
<add key="EHtarget" value="ehdevices" />
```

* Use  the SCPRPI.CMD file found in \devices\RaspberryPiGateway\RaspberryPiGateway\scripts\scprpi.cmd to copy all requisite files from your computer to the Pi. To use the .CMD file, you will need to 
        
    * Remove the "REM" and update the IP address
    * Change the Putty and Project directories in the .CMD file as necessary
    * Change bin\Debug or bin\Release to reflect whether you built the solution to Debug or Release. 

* Log in to the Raspberry Pi via PuTTY, and make /home/pi/RaspberryPiGateway/autorun.sh executable:

```
sudo chmod 755 /home/pi/RaspberryPiGateway/autorun.sh
```

* On the Raspberry Pi, modify /etc/rc.local by adding one line to start the gateway program on every boot (OK to skip this if you prefer to run manually after every reboot via /autorun.sh from a shell/SSH session):

```
Sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

* When you are in the nano editor, insert or change the reference to autorun.sh to be the following:

```
/home/pi/RaspberryPiGateway/autorun.sh &
```

* To exit the nano editor use Ctrl-x. To have the new settings take effect, reboot the Raspberry Pi by cycling the power or by issuing the command 

```
Sudo reboot
```

* At this point your Raspberry Pi is ready to be used as a Gateway for sensor devices connected over USB to send their data to Azure Event Hubs.

##Wifi

If you want to use Wifi instead of Ethernet in your configuration, you can follow online instructions such as [this one](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=26795)

##Log file

If you look at the RaspberryPiGateway.Log file on the Raspberry, you will see the same JSON formatted data being read from the serial port o the Raspberry as you saw being sent from the serial port of the Arduino:

```
Parsed data from serial port as: 
":0,"windgustmph_10m":0.0,"windgustdir_10m":0,"hmdt":44.9,"temp":73.1,"tempH":23.6,"rainin":0.0,"dailyrainin":0.0,"prss":100432.75,"batt":4.39,"lght":0.74}
```

Shortly later in the log file you will see “Message sent” meaning that same data was sent over AMQPS to Azure.
